## Credit Card Fraud Detection with Web-Based UI

# Description
A Machine learning model for credit card fraud detection for improved financial security
This project aims to develop a system that can detect credit card frauds using machine learning algorithms and provide a web-based user interface for users to report any suspicious activities.

# Features
Detects fraudulent transactions using machine learning algorithms
Provides a user-friendly web interface for reporting suspicious activities

# Technologies Used
Python
Flask
Scikit-Learn
Pandas
NumPy
JavaScript
HTML/CSS
# Installation
Clone repository and install necessary packages

# Running 
python API.py
This will start the Flask web server and the user interface can be accessed by navigating to http://localhost:5000 in a web browser.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset from Kaggle, which contains credit card transactions made over a two-day period in September 2013 by European cardholders.
